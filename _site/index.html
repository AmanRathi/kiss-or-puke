            An unfriendly captcha on Indian Railway website
        </div>
        <div class="post-description">
            <p>Indian railway website ask users to add or subtract two numbers for their captcha. People with all different age groups, backgrounds and capabilities use this portal for checking train status and seat availability. Having three digit numbers involved in calculation makes it more difficult for users to get captcha right without using calculators.</p>

            Careful design of Youtube’s home page in offline mode
        </div>
        <div class="post-description">
            <p>Youtube is a great example how to serve their users in case they are offline. Message is pretty clear with excellent illustration showing user in space. Great thing about Youtube is you can watch offline videos and CTA button for watching offline videos is up there on high priority. There is also a button “Tap to retry” in case user wants to reconnect to internet manually. Both button are designed keeping different users scenarios in mind.</p>

            Stop showing guilt induced dialog boxes
        </div>
        <div class="post-description">
            <p>Advanced Data Systems Corporation (ADSC) blog shows a dialog box to users when they land on any blog page. They offer a copy of their e-book in exchange for a user’s email. The problem with this dialog box is you can not close it without clicking on guilt induced message “No thank you, I don’t need to learn more about MACRA”. This type of messages should always be avoided as they make users feel ashamed.</p>

            Misinterpretable advertisement by Indian income tax department
        </div>
        <div class="post-description">
            <p>Indian income tax department published an advertisement to educate people about cash transactions but there were high chances that people may misinterpret the information. Designers made an assumption that people will read information top to bottom in a flow, but that’s not always the case, specially with newspapers. People scan the pages instead reading them word by word. In this ad there are high chances people may miss reading “Don’t” written at top and may read any of the bottom line directly, which will be highly misleading.</p>

            <p>We are so used to see the search bars at the top in most of the applications that as a designer we don’t give it much thought in some cases and put it on top. However, designers at Lyft did something unusual by placing it towards the bottom of the screen. The search bar in this design is easily reachable by the thumb.</p>

            ICICI Bank mobile app forces users to give feedback

        <div class="post-description">
            <p>There is no way a user can skip this review except by killing the app. Tapping on any area of the screen does not close this feedback dialog box. It may be frustrating for users if they don’t have enough experience with an app to make a decision to rate it and might end up giving a bad rating in frustration. However, by default highest rating is selected so chances are people may simply tap on the proceed button to get rid of this quickly. Product teams should not trust those type of ratings and deploy a better feedback system.</p>

            <p>Landed on Bookmyshow page and saw this message. It was difficult to know what was my
current location and how to change it. It took me a while to figure out how to overcome this situation. There is no clear visibility of current system status (current location) and no clear way to come out of this. Nielsen’s rules violated: “Visibility of system status” and “Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors”</p>
