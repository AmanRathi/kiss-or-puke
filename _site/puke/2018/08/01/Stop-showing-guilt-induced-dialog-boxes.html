<p>Indian income tax department published an advertisement to educate people about cash transactions but there were high chances that people may misinterpret the information. Designers made an assumption that people will read information top to bottom in a flow, but that’s not always the case, specially with newspapers. People scan the pages instead reading them word by word. In this ad there are high chances people may miss reading “Don’t” written at top and may read any of the bottom line directly, which will be highly misleading.</p>
