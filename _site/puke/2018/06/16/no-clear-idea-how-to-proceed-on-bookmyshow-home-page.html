<p>Landed on Bookmyshow page and saw this message. It was difficult to know what was my
current location and how to change it. It took me a while to figure out how to overcome this situation. There is no clear visibility of current system status (current location) and no clear way to come out of this. Nielsen’s rules violated: “Visibility of system status” and “Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors”</p>
