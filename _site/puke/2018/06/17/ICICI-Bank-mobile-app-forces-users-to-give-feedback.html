<p>There is no way a user can skip this review except by killing the app. Tapping on any area of the screen does not close this feedback dialog box. It may be frustrating for users if they donâ€™t have enough experience with an app to make a decision to rate it and might end up giving a bad rating in frustration. However, by default highest rating is selected so chances are people may simply tap on the proceed button to get rid of this quickly. Product teams should not trust those type of ratings and deploy a better feedback system.</p>
