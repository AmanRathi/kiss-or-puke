Youtube is a great example how to serve their users in case they are offline. Message is pretty clear with excellent illustration showing user in space. Great thing about Youtube is you can watch offline videos and CTA button for watching offline videos is up there on high priority. There is also a button “Tap to retry” in case user wants to reconnect to internet manually. Both button are designed keeping different users scenarios in mind.
