There is no way user can skip this review except by killing the app. Tapping on any area of screen does not close this feedback dialog box. It may be frustrating for users if they donâ€™t have enough experience with app to rate it and might end up giving bad rating. However by default highest rating is selected so chances are people may simply tap on proceed button to get rid of this quickly.
