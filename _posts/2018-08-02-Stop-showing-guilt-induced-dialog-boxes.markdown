Advanced Data Systems Corporation (ADSC) blog shows a dialog box to users when they land on any blog page. They offer a copy of their e-book in exchange for a user's email. The problem with this dialog box is you can not close it without clicking on guilt induced message “No thank you, I don’t need to learn more about MACRA”. This type of messages should always be avoided as they make users feel ashamed.
